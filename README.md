# Renty: Landlord/Tenant Communication Platform Example 

This is a small school project example for web application between landlord and tenant. 

Landlords can register for a user account and log in. A landlord can create, update, delete their properties and send invitation links to his tenant via an email, which has a serial key on that email. The tenant can use that serial key to sign up, or if a person has a user account already, he/she can enter that serial key to connect to the landlord. After this, a tenant is related to a landlord, and he can report, complain and inform about his property. Once a user makes one those operations, an email will be sent to the landlord about that operations and messages. All the reports, information of properties and users will be saved to the database. As per the suggestion of our Professor Dr Anam, We will incorporate a ratings and rankings system for both landlords and tenants.

This project is created based on laravel framework and used external library package for user ratings.
